First thing we need is an Ethereum Wallet. Let's go to Metamask and create Ethereum wallet.

We can use https://etherscan.io and put any wallet address and we can see what's going on with that wallet. So this is like a public address of this account. However there is also a private key to work with this account and we can go ahead and view it by clicking the three dots, go to account details and export private key.

Pneumonic phrase gives access to all the accounts created. Private key gives access to a particular account.

In the top left we can see different networks. However, when we buy Ethereum or work with Ethereum we are working with Ethereum Mainnet or whether we work with defi, web3, smartcontract we are working on Ethereum Mainnet. However, since we are Engineers and oftentimes we are going to want to test our applications or do some type of integration tests or just make sure our code actually work, so there is also called TestNets.

These are networks that resemble Ethereum and work exactly the same way as Ethereum, however they are not with real money and it's just for testing your application.
